Title of the Study with Rationale

EduConnect: Hybrid School Attendance, Engagement, and Notification System

Rationale / Justification:

Schools often rely on manual paper-based attendance sheets during events, assemblies, and co-curricular activities. While this method is familiar, it is also inefficient, prone to loss or damage, and requires additional time for manual encoding and verification. This process results in delays in recording attendance, difficulty tracking student participation, and a lack of real-time data that administrators can use for decision-making.

The proposed system, EduConnect, aims to address these problems by creating a hybrid digital attendance and engagement platform that automates event attendance, ensures data accuracy, and enhances communication. Through QR scanning, real-time logs, and integrated notifications, the system offers a more organized, secure, and accessible way to track student engagement during school activities. By eliminating paper sheets, EduConnect promotes efficiency, reduces clerical workload, and provides a reliable digital record that supports transparency and accountability within the academic community.


Methodology

Hybrid Development Approach (Waterfall + Agile)
The study will use a hybrid methodology that combines the structured planning of the Waterfall Model with the flexibility of Agile practices.


Justification:
The Waterfall component allows the group to clearly define the project requirements, including attendance workflow, student data structures, event management, and notification modules. Since the system is intended for a real school setting, establishing well-documented and sequential phases (requirements, design, development, testing, implementation) ensures clarity and alignment with institutional needs.
s
However, school systems often evolve, and user feedback—especially from administrators, teachers, and participating students—is essential. This is where Agile practices become useful. By using iterative development cycles, the team can continuously test modules such as QR scanning, the dashboard, or SMS/email notifications, and then refine them based on actual user experience. This blending of approaches ensures a balance of stability (through careful planning) and adaptability (through iterative improvements).
The hybrid approach was chosen because it provides the structure necessary for academic development while still allowing revisions and enhancements based on real-world testing, making it the most appropriate methodology for building an efficient and user-centered attendance management system.
